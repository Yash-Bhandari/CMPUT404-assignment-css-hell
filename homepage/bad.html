      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is William Sanford Nye, but you probably know me as Bill Nye the Science Guy.
        I am a mechanical engineer, science communicator, and television presenter.
        I am best known as the host of the science television
        show Bill Nye the Science Guy (1993–1999) and the Netflix show Bill Nye Saves
        the World (2017–2018), and for my many appearances in popular media as a
        science educator.

      <h3>Boeing</h3>
      <p>
        I started out as an engineer at Boeing.
        It was pretty interesting, but I felt an intense void in my life that only a children's science education
        television program could fill. </p>

        Bill Nye the Science Guy was an American half-hour live-action science
        education television program.
        It originally aired on PBS from 1993 to 1998.
        I helped create and produce the show and was the titular host.
